## How to Execute

The project can be executed by opening the `index.html` file in a modern browser. However, any changes in the TypeScript code must be saved and compiled to JavaScript. The compilation can be made executing `tsc .\genetic-algorithm.ts --module ES2015` in the terminal (you must have Node.js installed and TypeScript globally instaled via NPM).
